# TFG: Sporting events analysis through videos using Deep Learning

This repository contains the code and resources developed as part of the Final Grade Project (TFG) by Juan Martínez Cano and Javier Rodríguez Cordero. The proyect leverages deep learning techniques to indentify fouls in football matches, classified them by its type and severity, and determining wheter the fouls warrant disciplinary actions such as yellow or red cards.

The work is inspired by the _SoccerNet Multi-View Foul Recognition Challenge_ [(more information here)](https://www.soccer-net.org/tasks/multi-view-foul-recognition).

## TFG Objectives

The maing goal of this proyect is to develop an useful and efficient tool capable of assisting referees during matches by providing analysis of football actions. Specifically, the objectives are:
1. Foul Detection: Automatically detects wheter an action is foul or not.
2. Foul Classification: Categorize the detected foul by its type (Standing Tackle, Tackle, Holding, Pushing, Challenge, Dive, High Leg or Elbowing). 

## Dataset

The project uses the __SoccerNet-v2 Dataset__, specifically data related to the Multi-View Foul Recognition task. This dataset includes over 3,000 multi-view videos for training, validation, and testing and 273 actions for the challenge set.
